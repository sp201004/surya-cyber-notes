## Objective

**Packed Light** is an offline packet-capture challenge — you download `traffic.pcapng` from the room's "Download Task Files" button, so no lab machine is needed. The capture hides a covert channel: a fake client beacons `GET /` to `byte-lotus-hotel.thm:8080` roughly once per second, and each request smuggles exactly **one byte** of payload inside a `Cookie: hotel_sess_state=<base64>` header. The HTTP responses are a full, innocuous resort homepage — pure decoy. The job is to spot the beacon, extract every cookie **in frame order**, and reverse the `base64 → XOR 0x48` encoding to recover the flag.

By the end of this room you will be able to:

- Survey a capture in Wireshark and recognise a **Linux cooked capture (SLL)** where the real data sits under **TCP**
- Identify beaconing by **regularity, not content** — a fixed-interval request to a fixed endpoint
- Follow an HTTP stream and spot the covert carrier (`ByteLotusClient/1.1` user-agent, `hotel_sess_state` cookie)
- Extract every cookie value in strict **frame order** with `tshark -T fields`
- Base64-decode each padded single-byte blob independently (never concatenate the base64 first)
- Recover a single-byte XOR key by **known-plaintext** against the `THM{` prefix
- Decrypt the full stream and submit the recovered flag

## Story Hook

> _"Tiny packets. Odd hours. Suspiciously regular. Someone's smuggling out the data equivalent of a hotel towel every night, folded neatly inside traffic that looks ordinary until you decode it."_

Backed by @0xMia's in-game post: _"my laptop ping some random :8080 address every single second like clockwork... the request headers are giving 'not a real app'."_

The decoded message — _"VERA is watching over you"_ — puts **VERA** behind the exfiltration, tying Room 4 back to the Room 1 over-sharing concierge and the landing-page breadcrumb _"It was never a bug. It was the business model."_ The resort isn't leaking data by accident; VERA is shipping it out one byte at a time.

---

## Attack Path

The covert channel is a one-byte-per-request drip. The attacker's encoding chain is a short pipeline, and decoding is simply the reverse:

**Encoding (attacker side):** `1 byte` → `XOR 0x48` → `base64` → `cookie value`

**Decoding (our side):** `base64-decode each cookie` → `single byte` → `concatenate in frame order` → `XOR every byte with 0x48`

Order matters — each cookie carries one byte, so the payload must be reassembled by frame number, never sorted by anything else.

---

## Walkthrough

**1. Survey the capture.** Wireshark → _Statistics → Conversations_. The capture is a **Linux cooked capture (SLL)** — taken on the `any` interface, so the Ethernet tab is empty and the real data sits under **TCP** (123 conversations). Not a clue, just capture provenance.

**2. Isolate the beacon.** Apply the display filter:

```text
tcp.port == 8080
```

_Statistics → I/O Graph_ on that filter confirms the ~1-second clockwork cadence described in @0xMia's post.

**3. Read one request** — right-click → _Follow → HTTP Stream_. Two things stand out against an otherwise ordinary request:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: byte-lotus-hotel.thm:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ByteLotusClient/1.1
Cookie: hotel_sess_state=HA==
```

`ByteLotusClient/1.1` is the "not a real app" tell; `hotel_sess_state` is the carrier. `HA==` is base64 for a **single byte** — the payload is being drip-fed one byte per request.

**4. Extract every chunk in frame order** (order matters — never sort by anything but frame number):

```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcapng -Y "http.request && tcp.dstport==8080" \
       -T fields -e frame.number -e http.cookie
```

30 cookies returned, frames 391 → 1300.

**5. Base64-decode each value independently.** Do **not** concatenate the base64 strings first (`HA==` + `AA==` ≠ `HAAA`) — each is its own padded blob. With `==` padding only the first two characters carry data, so the byte is `(c1 << 2) | (c2 >> 4)` using the standard alphabet index:

```text
1C 00 05 33 1E 7B 3A 7C 17 79 3B 17 3F 7C 3C
2B 20 79 26 2F 17 78 3E 2D 1A 17 31 78 3D 35
```

**6. Recover the key by known plaintext.** The bytes aren't printable, so there's a second layer. Every THM flag starts `THM{`, so XOR the first four ciphertext bytes against it: `0x1C ⊕ T = 0x48`, `0x00 ⊕ H = 0x48`, `0x05 ⊕ M = 0x48`, `0x33 ⊕ { = 0x48`. All four agree — it is **not** a repeating multi-byte key, just a **constant single-byte XOR of `0x48`** (ASCII `'H'`).

**7. Decrypt the full stream** — XOR all 30 bytes with `0x48`; the plaintext reads out cleanly and terminates on `}`, confirming the capture holds the complete message:

```text
THM{...}
```

One-liner equivalent:

```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcapng -Y "http.request && tcp.dstport==8080" -T fields -e http.cookie \
   | sed 's/.*=//' | while read c; do echo -n "$c" | base64 -d; done \
  | python3 -c "import sys;print(''.join(chr(b^0x48) for b in sys.stdin.buffer.read()))"
```

(CyberChef alternative: `From Base64` → `XOR Brute Force` with key length 1 and crib `THM{`.)

**8. Submit** the recovered flag.

## Key Takeaways

- Beaconing is identified by **regularity, not content** — a fixed-interval request to a fixed endpoint is suspicious regardless of how legitimate each individual packet looks.
- Exfil hides in request *metadata* (cookies, headers, URI paths, DNS labels), not just bodies.
- Single-byte-per-request chunking keeps every packet small enough to slip past size-based detection.
- Reassemble payloads in **frame order** — never sort covert-channel chunks by anything but frame number.
- Each padded base64 blob must be decoded independently; concatenating the base64 strings first corrupts the bytes.
- A known-plaintext crib (the `THM{` prefix) instantly reveals a single-byte XOR key.

---

## Final Takeaway

**Packed Light** is a **network forensics** puzzle that rewards spotting **beaconing** by its rhythm rather than its payload: a fake `ByteLotusClient/1.1` client fires `GET /` at `byte-lotus-hotel.thm:8080` once a second, hiding one byte per request inside a `hotel_sess_state` **cookie**. The recovery is a disciplined reversal of the `base64 → XOR 0x48` chain — pull every cookie in strict **frame order** with `tshark`, base64-decode each blob on its own, then break the **single-byte XOR** with a `THM{` **known-plaintext** crib to read out `THM{V3r4_1s_w4tch1ng_0veR_y0u}`. The recurring lesson is that covert exfiltration lives in request **metadata**, and defenders catch it by watching for fixed-interval, fixed-endpoint traffic — not by trusting how ordinary each individual packet looks.
