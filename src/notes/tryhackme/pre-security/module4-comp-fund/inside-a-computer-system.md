**Converts**

```
AC
↓
DC
```

**Provides power to**

- Motherboard
- CPU

> UEFI replaced BIOS.

---

### Step 3 — POST
**Power-On Self Test**

**Purpose** — Checks:

**CPU**

**RAM**

**Keyboard**

**Storage**

**Hardware**

```
If something fails
↓
Beeps
↓
Error messages
↓
Boot stops
```

---

### Step 4 — Select Boot Device
UEFI follows Boot Priority.

**Example**

1. SSD
2. HDD
3. USB
4. Network

> If SSD contains OS → SSD selected.

---

### Step 5 — Bootloader

↓
Load OS into RAM
↓
Transfer control
↓
Operating System starts
```

---

### Operating System Starts

↓
User logs in
```

---

### Complete Boot Flow
```
Power Button
↓
PSU
↓
