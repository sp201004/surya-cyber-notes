## What is Python?

Python is a **High-Level, Interpreted, General Purpose Programming Language** created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**. It focuses on readability and simplicity. Unlike C/C++, Python uses simple English-like syntax.

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello World")
```

instead of:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World";
}
```

Python requires far less code.

## Why Python in Cyber Security?

Python is the most popular scripting language used by ethical hackers. It helps automate repetitive work.

**Examples:**
- Port Scanner
- Password Generator
- Malware Analysis
- Packet Analyzer
- Log Parser
- Web Scraper
- Exploit Development
- Network Automation

---

## Real World Example

Instead of manually checking 1000 IP addresses, Python can check all automatically. Instead of manually opening 500 log files, Python reads them automatically. **Automation saves time.**

---

## The Project of this Room

We create a simple game:
1. Computer secretly chooses a number.
2. Player keeps guessing.
3. Computer gives hints.
4. Eventually player wins.

## Program Flow

```text
Computer Starts
        │
Generate Random Number
        │
Tell User: "I'm thinking of a number"
        │
Take User Input
        │
Compare Guess
        │
    Correct?
    │      │
   No     Yes
   │       │
 Hint   Print Success
   │       │
 Repeat   End
```

---

## Understanding Variables

### What is a Variable?
A variable is simply **a named container used to store data.** Think of it as a labeled box.

**Example:**
```text
Name Box:  Surya
Age Box:   22
```

Instead of remembering the value, we remember the variable name.

### Variable Analogy

```text
Variable
↓
Storage Box
↓
Contains Value
↓
Can Change Anytime
```

**Example:**
```python
name = "Surya"
age = 22
city = "Ballia"
```

**Memory looks like:**
```text
name ─────► Surya
age ───────► 22
city ──────► Ballia
```

---

## Variables Used in This Room

There are three important variables in our game.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `secret` | Stores the hidden random number (e.g., `secret = 14`). Player never sees this. |
| `guess` | Stores the player's input (e.g., `guess = 10`, later `guess = 15`). |
| `tries` | Counts attempts (`0 → 1 → 2 → 3`). |

**Relationship:**
```text
secret  → Hidden Number
guess   → Player Guess
tries   → Attempt Counter
```

---

## Data Types

Everything stored inside Python belongs to a type.

| Data Type | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Integer | `10`, `-8` | Whole Numbers |
| Float | `3.14`, `2.5` | Decimal Numbers |
| String | `"Hello"` | Text |
| Boolean | `True`, `False` | Only two values. Used in conditions. |

---

## Importing Modules

Large programs are divided into modules. Need extra functionality? Import it.

**Example:**
```python
import random
```

This loads Python's random library.

**Module Analogy:**
```text
Python  →  Toolbox
Need Hammer?  →  Import Hammer  →  Use Hammer
```

---

## Random Module

The random module generates unpredictable numbers. Used in Games, Simulations, Password Generation, Cryptography (though not always secure enough), and Testing.

### randint()

**Syntax:** `random.randint(a,b)`
**Returns:** `a <= number <= b` (Both numbers included).

**Example:**
```python
random.randint(1,20)
```
**Possible outputs:** `4, 8, 17, 20, 1`. Every execution may differ.

---

## Creating the Secret Number

```python
import random
secret = random.randint(1,20)
```

**Explanation:**
```text
Import Random Library
↓
Generate Number
↓
Store inside `secret`
↓
Ready for Game
```

---

## Printing Output

Python displays information using `print()`.

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello")
# Output: Hello

print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20")
# Output: I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20
```

---

## Taking User Input

Python uses `input()`.

**Example:**
```python
name = input("Enter Name: ")
```
User types: `Surya`. Variable becomes: `name = "Surya"`.

### Important Thing
`input()` ALWAYS returns a **String**. Even if the user types `15`, Python stores `"15"`, NOT `15`. This confuses many beginners.

---

## Type Conversion

Need an integer? Use `int()`.

**Example:**
```python
text = input("Take a guess: ")
guess = int(text)
```

**Flow:**
```text
Keyboard → "15" → int() → 15 → guess
```

### Why Convert?
Without conversion, `"10"` and `20` cannot be compared properly. You need `10` and `20` (both integers) to compare them.

---

## Code Written So Far

```python
import random
secret = random.randint(1,20)
tries = 0
guess = 0

print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20")
text = input("Take a guess: ")
guess = int(text)
tries = tries + 1
```

**Code Flow:**
```text
Start
↓
Import Random
↓
Generate Secret Number
↓
Initialize Variables
↓
Display Message
↓
Take Input
↓
Convert Input
↓
Increase Tries
↓
Ready for Comparison
```

---

## Conditional Statements

Programs should make decisions. Instead of executing every line, Python decides "What should happen?" based on conditions. A conditional checks whether something is True or False.

**Example:**
```text
Is Age > 18?
↓
Yes
↓
Execute Code
```

### Real Life Examples

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **Rain?** | Yes → Take Umbrella. Else → Don't Take. |
| **Password Correct?** | Yes → Login. Else → Access Denied. |
| **Balance > ₹100?** | Yes → Withdraw Money. Else → Insufficient Balance. |

## Python Conditional Statements

Python mainly uses `if`, `elif`, `else`.

### if
Runs only when condition is TRUE.
```python
marks = 95
if marks > 90:
    print("Excellent")
```

### elif
Means "Else If". Checks another condition.
```python
if condition:
    # do something
elif condition:
    # do something else
```

### else
Runs when every condition becomes FALSE.
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

---

## Flow of if-elif-else

```text
Condition 1
      │
True? ──────Yes────► Execute
      │
     No
      │
Condition 2
      │
True? ──────Yes────► Execute
      │
     No
      │
Execute Else
```

---

## Comparison Operators

Python compares values using operators.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `==` | Equal | `20 == 20` | True |
| `!=` | Not Equal | `20 != 20` | False |
| `>` | Greater Than | `10 > 5` | True |
| `<` | Less Than | `5 > 20` | False |
| `>=` | Greater or Equal | | |
| `<=` | Less or Equal | | |

---

## Guessing Logic

Player enters `guess`. Computer compares `guess` with `secret`.

**Possible cases:**
```text
Guess
│
├── Out of Range
├── Too Low
├── Too High
└── Correct
```

### Out of Range
Allowed numbers are 1 to 20. Anything else (`0, 21, 40, -5`) is invalid.
```python
if guess < 1 or guess > 20:
    print("That number is out of range.")
```

### Too Low
```python
elif guess < secret:
    print("Too low")
```

### Too High
```python
elif guess > secret:
    print("Too high")
```

### Correct Guess
Since every other condition failed, guess must be equal to secret.
```python
else:
    print("You got it!")
```

---

## Loops

Without loops, the user gets ONLY ONE chance. That's boring. We need repeated execution. A Loop repeats code until a condition fails.

### while Loop
Runs until condition becomes FALSE.
```python
while condition:
    statements
```

### Guess Game Loop
`while guess != secret:`
**Meaning:** Keep asking until Guess becomes Secret.

---

## Loop Flow

```text
Guess Correct?
│
No
↓
Ask Again → Compare → Correct? → No → Repeat
↓
Yes
↓
Exit Loop
```

---

## Complete Program Flow

```text
Program Starts
↓
Generate Secret Number
↓
Initialize Variables
↓
Display Message
↓
While Guess != Secret
↓
Take Input
↓
Convert Integer
↓
Increase Tries
↓
Compare (Low? / High? / Out of Range?)
↓
Correct
↓
Game Ends
```

---

## Final Program Structure

```python
import random
secret = random.randint(1,20)
tries = 0
guess = 0

print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20")

while guess != secret:
    text = input("Take a guess: ")
    guess = int(text)
    tries = tries + 1
    
    if guess < 1 or guess > 20:
        print("That number is out of range.")
    elif guess < secret:
        print("Too low")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high")
    else:
        print("You got it! It took you", tries, "tries.")
```

## Memory Tricks

| Function / Syntax | What to think |
|---|---|
| `print()` | Show on Screen |
| `input()` | Take from Keyboard |
| `int()` | TEXT → NUMBER |
| `randint()` | Random Integer Between `a` and `b` (Both Included) |
| `if` | Decision |
| `elif` | Else + If |
| `else` | Everything Failed → Default Action |
| `while` | Condition True → Keep Repeating |
| `!=` | `!` means NOT |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct Way |
|---|---|
| Forgetting `import random` | Import the module before using `randint()` |
| Comparing `"10"` with `10` | Convert using `int()` |
| Thinking `input()` returns an integer | It always returns a string |
| Using an undefined variable | Initialize variables first |
| Assuming random numbers repeat | `randint()` generates different values on each execution |
| Using `=` inside condition | Use `==` |
| Infinite while loop | Update loop variables correctly |
| Forgetting `:` | Every `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while` needs a colon |
| Wrong indentation | Python depends on indentation |

## One Shot Revision

This room builds a number-guessing game step by step, introducing each Python concept in order:

1. **Variables** — store values such as the secret number and the player's guess.
2. **Random number** — pick the secret number to guess.
3. **`print()`** — show output to the player.
4. **`input()`** — read the player's guess from the keyboard.
5. **`int()`** — convert the text input into a number for comparison.
6. **`if / elif / else`** — decide what to do based on the guess.
7. **Comparison operators** — check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
8. **`while` loop** — keep asking until the correct number is entered.

→ Guess game completed.
