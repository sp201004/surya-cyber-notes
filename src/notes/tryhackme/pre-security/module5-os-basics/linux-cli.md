# Objective
Learn the fundamentals of the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), navigate the filesystem, locate files, read file contents, and gather system information.

---

# What is Linux?
Linux is an **open-source operating system** widely used in:

- Servers
- Cloud Computing
- Cybersecurity
- Networking
- Embedded Devices
- Android
- Supercomputers

More than **90% of web servers** run Linux.

---

# What is CLI?
CLI = **Command Line Interface**

Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands.

Example:

**GUI**

```
📁 Click Folder
```

**CLI**

```bash
cd Documents
```

---

# Why Cybersecurity Professionals Prefer CLI
 Faster

**Lightweight**

**Automation**

**Remote Management (SSH)**

**Powerful**

 Most security tools run inside Terminal

Examples:

- Nmap
- Wireshark CLI
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite CLI
- Hydra
- Gobuster
- John the Ripper

---

# Terminal Structure
Example

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~$
```

**Breakdown**

```
ubuntu        → Username

tryhackme     → Hostname

~             → Home Directory

$             → Normal User

#             → Root User
```

---

# Linux Filesystem
Everything starts from

```
/
```

**Example**

```
/
├── home
│
├── etc
│
├── var
│
├── usr
│
├── tmp
│
├── root
│
└── opt
```

Unlike Windows,

**Windows**

```
C:\Users\Surya\
```

**Linux**

```
/home/ubuntu/
```

---

# Home Directory
Every user gets one.

**Example**

```bash
/home/ubuntu
```

**Shortcut**

# Common Beginner Mistakes
 Forgetting spaces

**Wrong**

```bash
cdDocuments
```

**Correct**

```bash
cd Documents
```

---

**Wrong Path**

**Wrong**

```bash
cd Downloads/Documents
```

**Correct**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Documents
```

---

**Forgetting**

```
..
```

to move back.

---

**Running**

```bash
find /
```

instead of

```bash
find ~
```

Search becomes very slow.

### Q1. What is the purpose of `pwd`?
Shows the current working directory.

---

### Q2. Difference between `ls` and `ls -al`?
- `ls` → Lists visible files.
- `ls -al` → Lists all files (including hidden) with detailed information.

---

### Q3. What does `whoami` return?
The username of the currently logged-in user.

---

### Q4. What is the difference between `uname` and `cat /etc/os-release`?
- `uname` → Kernel/OS information.
- `os-release` → Linux distribution details.

---

### Q5. Why is `df -h` preferred over `df`?
Because `-h` displays storage in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).

## Linux CLI Basics Complete!
You now have a strong foundation in Linux terminal navigation and essential commands. Mastering these basics will make advanced cybersecurity tasks significantly easier.

## Interview Questions

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Q. What does pwd do?** | Shows current working directory. |
| **Q. Difference between ls and ls -l?** | ls<br>Only names.<br>ls -l<br>Detailed information. |
| **Q. Why do hidden files start with "."?** | Because Linux treats dot-prefixed files as configuration files. |

## Memory Tricks

- `pwd` → "where am I?" · `ls` → "what's here?" · `cd` → "go there" · `find` → "search" · `cat` → "read"
- `whoami` → "who am I?" · `uname` → "what OS?" · `df -h` → "how much disk?" · `os-release` → "which Linux?"

## Quick Revision

Core Linux commands every analyst should know:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pwd` | Print working (current) directory |
| `ls` | List files |
| `ls -l` | Detailed list |
| `ls -al` | Include hidden files |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `cd ..` | Go back one level |
